# blockchain

This project is still in development. 

### Description:

The blockchain project is mostly an educational-purpose project which aims to develope robust wallets from scratch (no external libraries except for python built-in libraries) for some well known cryptocurrencies, and having in mind real world applications like companies or small businesses. 

### Status:

Currently only supporting Bitcoin.

### Achievments:

-Eliptic Curve Criptography (secp256k1)
-Transactions
-Bip32
-Bip39
-Segwit Compliant
-Multi signature

Some of the code here comes from the book Programming Bitcoin, so a big share of the credit goes to Jimmy Song (the author of the book).

### How to use:
